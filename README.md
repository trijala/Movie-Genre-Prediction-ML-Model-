# Movie-Genre-Prediction-ML-Model

Created a machine learning model- Logistic Regression in PySpark and Hadoop to train and predict the genres associated with a movie.

Train.csv has movie summaries of around 31K movies along with their genres.
Test.csv has just plot summaries. A movie can have multiple genres associated with it. This is used to train the predictive analytics model.

Improved accuracy using feature engineering methods like TF-IDF and word2vec.
